# WireHDL
WireHDL is a HDL with a CPU-centric design. Built with Robust concurrency and parallelism support, WireHDL aims to simplify the creation of multicore architectures while providing tools to simulate and optimize your CPU components. WireHDL's focus on modularity and reusable circuit definitions makes it a powerful tool for building scalable, high-performance hardware systems.

Features Include but are not limited to:
-CPU-optimized HDL for designing complex processor systems.
-Native support for concurrent simulations and parallel executions.
-Modular, reusable components to accelerate hardware development.
